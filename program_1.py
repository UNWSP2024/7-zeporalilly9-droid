# Program #1: Rainfall
# Design a program that lets the user enter the total rainfall for each of 12 months into a list.
# The program should calculate and display the total rainfall for the year, 
# the average monthly rainfall, # and the months with the highest and lowest amounts.    print(f"Average monthly rainfall: {average:.2f} inches")
    print(f"Highest rainfall: {max_rain:.2f} inches in {max_month}")
    print(f"Lowest rainfall: {min_rain:.2f} inches in {min_month}")
